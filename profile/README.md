# 👋 Hi there, we're [Galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai)

## 🙋‍♀️ On a mission to empower 1 billion people with AI.

We're building the world's most accessible and powerful AI platform — one that brings together 2,000+ tools into a single, affordable subscription. 

In 2025, we're taking our first steps into open source by releasing key tools from our platform — starting with AI workflows. 

This will give developers and teams the building blocks to create their own AI workflows, apps, and agents.

## 🚀 Our Projects

- **[Workflow](https://workflow.galaxy.ai)**: Visual AI workflow builder – like n8n, but built for chaining LLMs, image models, APIs, and more.  
  [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/GalaxyAI-Team/workflow.galaxy.ai)

> More open-source projects launching soon. Stay tuned!

## 🌈 Contribution Guidelines

We love our community and welcome contributions of all kinds — code, ideas, and improvements.

We reward top contributors every month with **cash bonuses**.  

Let’s build the future of AI together.
